                                   NOTES


This is my entry to the Data Compression contest.  The program compresses

well but runs slowly. 


The program was developed on an Amiga 2000, then ported to a PC XT clone

with MS DOS 3.3.  It is written in portable standard C and compiles

under Power C version 1.1.6 and Turbo C++ version 1.01.  The supplied

.EXE file was generated by Turbo C++.


To generate the executable file from the source file, simply compile and

link SIXPACK.C using a small memory model (I used the optimize switches

-G -O -Z for Turbo C++, but these are not essential). 

        Turbo C++:      tcc -G -O -Z sixpack.c

        Power C:        pc/e sixpack.c


To compress a file, enter:

        SIXPACK inputfilename outputfilename


To decompress a file, enter:

        SIXPACK inputfilename outputfilename d

(the "d" means "decompress", but any argument will do)
